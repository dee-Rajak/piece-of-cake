# piece-of-cake

##Welcome !

This is kind of my-do-anything repository.

What I do here ?
    -> Firstly, I am getting used to git.
    -> I am trying to manage all my college works here. (work-on-progress, this one)
    -> There's also one 'fun-to-code' directory, wherein I will manage my problem solving works.

I guess this is it for now, this is just one step to organizing myself.

Bye, bye... Have a good-day ahead.

P.S
    I am doing git & github dosen't mean that, I am good at my field of work.
    I am in a learning phase, which just doesn't seems to end. (^^) haha
