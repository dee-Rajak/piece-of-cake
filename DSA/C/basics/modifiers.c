    Modifiers are,
    1. auto             declare and define      (here, define means assigning memory)
    2. extern   (imp)   only declare variable
    3. register         for fast eaecution (but, it really depends on compiler, compiler optimizes the code)
    4. static   (imp)   (it actually replaces "global" in working
                            it is available throughout the file but
                                not the whole project, it also retains the values
                                    also it contains only constant literals)
